# Course description
Rules of play shape competitive games from checkers to football. But how do the rules of interaction shape non-competitive play? In this course, we will explore, code and test design strategies for playful group interactions.

Some of the questions we will ask and attempt to answer:

   * What encourages participation?
   * Can we work together as a group if “every man is for himself”?
   * When does influence turn into interference?
   * Are leaders necessary? Is it possible to lead from behind?
   * What’s the difference between taking turns and having a conversation?
   * What participate if individual effort is subsumed under collective output?
   * Does democracy = inclusion?
   * What happens when the slowest person sets the pace?

Interaction inputs we will play with will include: mouse, keyboard, mobile device sensors, and microphone. Outputs will include, visuals, text and sound. We will use p5, websockets and node.js for real-time interaction. Class time will be split between playing with and critiquing examples and translating design strategies into code and logic.

## Pre-requisites
ICM or the equivalent.

## Grading
- 40% for showing up (on time!) and participating with curiosity and enthusiasm.
- 40% for homework.
- 20% for the final project.
- More than 2 unexcused absences qualifies you for a failure.
- 2 lateness of 15 minutes or more qualifies as 1 unexcused absence.
